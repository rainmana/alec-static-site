My name is Alec Akin and I am a full-time nerd. I'm currently a senior cybersecurity engineer in the telecom industry as well as the CTO for the Police Data Accessiblity Project (https://policedap.org) and I love to spend my free time learning about new technologies and growing my skillset as well as teaching others the same.

I intend to use this page to record my thoughts, helpful links and tips, make sure I don't forget anything useful, as well as expand my knowledge of the technologies that make this site possible. Please feel free to reach out via any of the methods on the homepage!

Hi Stephen! Just showing you how Git works!
